SUBLIME

## Rapid file switching

Sometimes you can get hundreds of files in a single project and you need a way to switch between them quickly. With `âŒ˜`P (Mac) or `Ctrl`P (Linux/Windows), you can type in the name of a file and even method or text you want to go to within that file.

## Lots of plugins and massive customizability

Sublime Text comes with a base feature set that's useful to _any_ programmer, but sometimes you need something more specialized. For example, you may want to:

- [Anticipate Ruby runtime errors _before_ you run your code](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-ruby)
- [Automatically delete trailing spaces](https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces)
- [Integrate with Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git)

And much, much more. Check out the [Sublime Text website](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for more info.
