  title: Create a website with a directory of students
  criteria:
    - a `/students` route exists, that lists the first names of 3 other Code Lab students (seek their permission first - if they're not comfortable with their first name on the page, you can make up a name)
    - a route for each student exists at `/students/NAME`, where their name and favorite color is featured
