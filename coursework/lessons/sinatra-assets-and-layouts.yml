  title: Refactor (i.e. improve without changing functionality) a previous project to make the code cleaner
  criteria:
    - The code from the previous Sinatra project is copied into this project folder
    - You have more than one view file served to more than one route
    - A `.css` and `.js` file are included on every page via a `link` and `script` element, respectively (make sure those files have some effect on the page so that we know it worked)
    - A `layout.erb` file is used to DRY up your HTML
    - There are not _any_ unnecessarily duplicated lines of code between view files
