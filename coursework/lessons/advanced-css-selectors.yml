project:
  title: Build a list of something, using either a `ul`, `ol`, or `table` element
  criteria:
    - not have any classes or ids included anywhere in the HTML (we can do a lot without them!)
    - "include a list where the background alternates every other item (hint: use the `:nth-child` selector)"
    - include a visible change on list items when you hover over them with your mouse
    - include special, visible styles on only the first and last elements in the list
    - include at least one empty list item that your CSS will hide using the `:empty` selector
    - return no errors (warnings are OK) when the HTML document is uploaded to the [W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload)
    - return no errors or warnings when contents of the CSS file are pasted into [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/)
