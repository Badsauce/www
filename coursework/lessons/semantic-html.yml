project:
  title: "Create an HTML page with a list of blog posts (about anything, but preferrably outrageous: for example, from the perspective of your cat, including only musings on grapefruit)"
  criteria:
    - include a `header` element with the name of your blog and a tagline
    - include a `footer` element with copyright information and a design credit
    - include either a working `video` or `audio` element (you can use other sources, but `http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4` is a good video source and `http://www.w3schools.com/tags/horse.mp3` is a good audio source)
    - include at least 2 blog posts (of at least one sentence each)
    - return no errors (warnings are OK) when uploaded to the [W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload)
    - include the `main`, `article`, `section`, `blockquote`, `figure`, and `figcaption` elements, in contexts where they make semantic sense
